WARNING 1 [file grompp.mdp]:
  You are generating velocities so I am assuming you are equilibrating a
  system. You are using Parrinello-Rahman pressure coupling, but this can
  be unstable for equilibration. If your system crashes, try equilibrating
  first with Berendsen pressure coupling. If you are not equilibrating the
  system, you can probably ignore this warning.

Determining Verlet buffer for a tolerance of 0.005 kJ/mol/ps at 300 K
Calculated rlist for 1x1 atom pair-list as 1.034 nm, buffer size 0.034 nm
Set rlist, assuming 4x4 atom pair-list, to 1.000 nm, buffer size 0.000 nm
Note that mdrun will redetermine rlist based on the actual pair-list setup
