    "As our RC we use the distance between the two atoms forming the central hydrogen-bond the two bases in a pair. Let's have a look at the system and the reaction coordinate using VMD. The `-e` flag below tells VMD to excute the commands that are in the following tcl-script. These commands change how the system is visually represented. For instance, we have hidden all the water to better see the DNA itself, and we have put nice colors on the atoms defining the RC of our target base pair. Now run:"
